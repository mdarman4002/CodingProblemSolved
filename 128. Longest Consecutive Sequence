Method longestConsecutive:
    - Description: Finds the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an array of integers.

    Parameters:
        - nums: int[] - Input array of integers.

    Returns:
        - int: Length of the longest consecutive sequence.

    Steps:
        1. Create a HashMap `hm` to store each number from the input array as keys and their presence as values (initially set to false).
        2. Iterate through the input array `nums` and populate the HashMap `hm` with numbers from the array as keys and set their corresponding values to false.
        3. Iterate through the keys of `hm`:
            a. For each key, check if the key-1 is not present in `hm` (indicating the start of a sequence).
            b. If key-1 is not present, set the value of the current key to true, marking it as the start of a sequence.
        4. Initialize a variable `max` to 0 to keep track of the maximum consecutive sequence length.
        5. Iterate through the keys of `hm` again:
            a. For each key, if its value is true (indicating it's the start of a sequence):
                - Initialize a variable `k` to 1 (representing the current consecutive length).
                - While `hm` contains key+k (indicating consecutive numbers), increment `k`.
            b. Update `max` by taking the maximum of its current value and `k`.
        6. Return the value of `max`, which represents the length of the longest consecutive sequence in the input array.


Explanation:

The longestConsecutive method uses a HashMap to efficiently determine the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an array of integers.
It marks the start of a sequence when it finds a number that does not have the previous number in the sequence present in the HashMap.
Then, it iterates through the HashMap to find consecutive numbers and calculates the length of each sequence, updating the max variable with the maximum length encountered.
Finally, it returns the length of the longest consecutive sequence found.
