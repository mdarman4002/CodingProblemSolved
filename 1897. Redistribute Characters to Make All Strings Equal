Class: Solution

Description:
This class contains a method to check if it is possible to make all strings in an array equal by rearranging their characters.

Method: makeEqual(String[] words)

Description:
This method checks if it's possible to rearrange characters within the strings in the input array 'words' such that all strings become equal.

Parameters:
- words: An array of strings to be checked for equality.

Returns:
- true if it's possible to make all strings equal, false otherwise.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize an integer array 'frequency' of size 26 to store the frequency of each character.
2. Iterate through each string in the 'words' array:
   a. Iterate through each character in the current string and update the frequency array accordingly.
3. After counting frequencies for all strings, check if the frequency of each character is divisible by the total number of strings in 'words'.
4. If any character's frequency is not divisible by the total number of strings, return false as it's not possible to make all strings equal.
5. If all characters' frequencies are divisible, return true indicating it's possible to make all strings equal.

Example Usage:
String[] words = {"abc", "bca", "cba"};
Solution solution = new Solution();
boolean canMakeEqual = solution.makeEqual(words);
System.out.println("Can make equal: " + canMakeEqual);
