 * LeetCode Problem 1255 - Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters

 * Given a list of words, each word consists of lowercase letters with scores.

 * the sum less than or equal to the given maxScore. 
 * Each letter's score may be different. You need to have the maximum sum of 
 * scores formed by the given letters without exceeding the maxScore.
