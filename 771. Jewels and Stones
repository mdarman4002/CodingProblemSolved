Class: Solution

Description:
This class contains a method to count the number of jewels that appear in a given collection of stones. It compares each character in the jewels string with each character in the stones string to count the occurrences.

Method: numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones)

Description:
This method calculates the number of jewels that appear in the given collection of stones.

Parameters:
- jewels: A string representing the types of jewels (unique characters).
- stones: A string representing a collection of stones where jewels may appear.

Returns:
- The count of jewels that appear in the stones collection.

Algorithm:
1. Convert the jewels and stones strings into character arrays for efficient character comparison.
2. Initialize a variable 'count' to 0 to store the count of jewels found.
3. Use nested loops to compare each character in 'jewels' with each character in 'stones':
   a. If a character in 'jewels' matches a character in 'stones', increment the 'count' variable.
4. Return the final 'count' as the number of jewels found in stones.
